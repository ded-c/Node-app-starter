# Node-App-Starter
A boilerplate for Node.js web applications.

This boilerplate is meant to make it easy to get up and running on web applications using Node/Express on the backend with the option to easily connect to a MongoDB database using Mongoose.

The back-end file structure also includes:
* Routes - Where we can define API routes and whatnot.
* Controllers - Where route handlers/controllers go. 
* Models - Where we can define any Mongoose Schemas we have.

On the front-end a small Webpack configuration is set up to allow for Javascript compilation with Babel as well as compilation of SASS to CSS. 

All static files meant for the front-end including HTML files are served up by express from the client directory.
