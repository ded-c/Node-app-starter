# Node-App-Starter
A boilerplate for Node.js web applications.

This boilerplate is meant to make it easy to get up and running on web applications using Node/Express on the backend with the option to easily connect to a MongoDB database using Mongoose.

On the front-end a small Webpack configuration is set up to allow for Javascript compilation with Babel. 

All static files meant for the front-end including HTML files are served up by express from the client directory.
