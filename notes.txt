Right now to make this Boilerplate project work you must run:

    - npm run server
    - npm run compile:sass
    - npm run watch 

If you want to use a database then you'll also need to get a mongo db up and running and then copy/paste the URI into the config/dev.js and/or config/prod.js

Overview of Some Possible Types of Boilerplate 


If we choose to use Node on our backend, we have lots of options for the rest of our tech stack. 

All of these examples will make use of Express.

On the back end we could either use a template engine like Jade or EJ6 and use res.render(..) or we could just write html and use

    app.use(express.static('client'));

to serve up our static files.

On the front end we have lots of options. We could just do a basic HTML, CSS, JS with assets structure or if we wanted to use a build step we could extend that a bit with a build folder and maybe a webpack config file. 

We could also use some kind of framework like React, Angular, Vue etc.

On this boilerplate I think I'll set up the front end so that there is some kind of build step which allows us to use SASS and ES6 and whatnot.
